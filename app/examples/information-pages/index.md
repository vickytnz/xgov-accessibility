layout: example
title: Do not use a question as a heading unless a user can answer it on the page
description: If you put a question in a form page, it needs to have a way for a user to answer it.
tags: "Design"
mistake:
- description:
  link: information-pages/mistake
  height: 700px
  reason: In this example, 'can you apply' is just a heading. The only options are to 'continue' or 'return to GOV'UK' - neither of which answers the question. Another better option is to turn this into an actual question with answers.
improvement:
- description: If possible, ask multiple conditions with multiple questions that people can work through.
  link: information-pages/improved
  height: 700px
  reason: Rewriting the header to be a sentence makes it clear that the user does not have to answer anything.
- description: If the question cannot be made into multiple input fields (for example because the information cannot be used again, therefore breaking other WCAG rules) the question can be changed into a complex quesiton.
  link: information-pages/improved-2
  height: 750px
  reason: This still allows the page to have a question that can be answered.
