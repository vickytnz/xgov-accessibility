title: Do not use a question as a heading unless a user can answer it on the page
description: If you put a question in a form page, it needs to have a way for a user to answer it.

  reason: In this example, 'can you apply' is just a heading. The only options are to 'continue' or 'return to GOV'UK' - neither of which answers the question. Another better option is to turn this into an actual question with answers.

  reason: Rewriting the header to be a sentence makes it clear that the user does not have to answer anything.   
- link: improved-2
  height: 750px
  reason: If the question is in a heading because users need to review a lot of criteria, ask it in a way that they can select what applies to them, such as a filtering question [to be added]
