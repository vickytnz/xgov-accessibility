This project was started by Vicky Teinaki (design) and Lori Thomson (accessibility) in early 2024 as a walkthrough prototype. The early version of this tool is abailable as a passsowrd protected demo built on the GOV.UK Prototype Kit (more details available on the [accessibility-examples Github code repository](https://github.com/vickytnz/accessibility-examples)).

Caroine Jarrett has been actively involved in this project since June 2024 giving support on content.

Thanks to Adam Liptrot for comments (and his related project, the [Pattern Checker Chrome plugin](https://liptrot.org/pattern-checker/).
