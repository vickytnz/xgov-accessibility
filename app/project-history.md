This project was started by Vicky Teinaki (design) and Lori Thomson (accessibility) in early 2024 as a walkthrough prototype. It was created as a password-protected demo built on the GOV.UK Prototype Kit (more details available on the [accessibility-examples Github code repository](https://github.com/vickytnz/accessibility-examples)).

Caroine Jarrett has been actively involved in this project since June 2024 giving support on content.

Thanks to Adam Liptrot for comments (and his related project, the [Pattern Checker Chrome plugin](https://liptrot.org/pattern-checker/).

In August 2024 the website was switched to use the [GOV.UK Eleventy Plugin](https://x-govuk.github.io/govuk-eleventy-plugin/get-started/).

The first version without a password was released 3 September 2024 with the following examples:

- complex question
- form fields, hints and links
- information pages
- input labels
- link focus
- list
- tabs
- unique text with repeated actions
- accordions
