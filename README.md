## Fix common accessibility issues in forms

This is a project to show common mistakes and improvements for forms designed using GOV.UK Frontend.

## Prototype
The current prototype is available with password protection while it is still under development.

The site has some known bugs with the passwords showing up so may need a few refreshes to get in.
